# Inferring Directed Genotype Networks: with Applications to S. Typhimurium
Copyright (C) 2020 Oliver Cliff.

This code can be used to infer directed networks for point processes that can be correlated using some type of spatiotemporal closeness criterion.

In our work, we focused on S. Typhimurium, where the isolates were represented by MLVA (i.e., a sequence of 5 numbers indicating their genotype) that form a point-process.
